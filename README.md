# Principal-Component-Analysis (PCA) on Anderson Cancer Center
 
Overview
This project applies to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Anderson Cancer Center using the breast cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets` to identify key variables and develop model to address the growing number of referrals at the center.

Step by Step Analysis
Load Dataset - Import the `load_breast_cancer` dataset from `scikit-learn`.
Preprocessing - Standardize features using `StandardScaler`.
Apply PCA - Reduce the dataset to **2 principal components**.
Variance Explained - Check how much variance each component retains.
Visualization - Scatter plot of PCA results.
Logistic Regression for classification.
